<b>Abstract.</b> Recently, neuromorphic vision sensors are gaining more and more attentions in computer vision due to the advantages over conventional cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range (HDR), little redundancy and low power. The applications of which include autonomous driving, drone visual navigation, industrial inspection and video surveillance, especially in fast motion and challenging illumination conditions. Indeed, neuromorphic vision is an important branch of neuromorphic engineering, which uses the silicon retina to mimic the structure and mechanism of biological visual sensing system, and it is also a research hotspot in the field of neuroscience and machine vision. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of neuromorphic vision consisting of bio-inspired vision sampling models, the types of neuromorphic sensors, asynchronous event-based signal processing, event-based feature representation and the applications. Then, we also propose the challenges and the meaningful future research directions on neuromorphic vision sensors. Finally, we further discuss the potential profound influence on machine vision and artificial intelligence.
