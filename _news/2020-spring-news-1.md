<b>Abstract.</b> Recently, neuromorphic vision sensors are gaining more and more attention in computer vision owning to the advantages over conventional cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range (HDR), low redundancy and low power. The applications of which include autonomous driving, drone visual navigation, industrial inspection, video surveillance, and the internet of things (IoT), especially in fast motion and challenging illumination conditions. Neuromorphic vision is an important branch of neuromorphic engineering, which uses the silicon retina to mimic the structure and mechanism of the biological visual sensing system and aims to address the shortages of traditional frame-based cameras, and it is also a research hotspot in the field of neuroscience and computer vision. Indeed, neuromorphic vision sensors work in a completely different way and use what it called ¡°spikes¡± to compute instead of frame-by-frame basis, in which asynchronous spatial-temporal spikes are continuous-time and sparse point-sets in three-dimensional space. This novel technology fundamentally changes the sensing and computing ways in vision information, so that existing computer vision techniques cannot be directly applied to asynchronous spikes from neuromorphic cameras. Nevertheless, neuromorphic vision remains an active area of research in academia and efforts are ongoing to overcome some significant challenges.
