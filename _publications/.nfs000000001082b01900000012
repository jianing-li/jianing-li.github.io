<b>Abstract.</b> Recently, neuromorphic vision sensors are gaining more and more attention in computer vision owning to the advantages over conventional cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range (HDR), low redundancy and low power. The applications of which include autonomous driving, drone visual navigation, industrial inspection, video surveillance, and the internet of things (IoT), especially in fast motion and challenging illumination conditions. Neuromorphic vision is an important branch of neuromorphic engineering, which uses the silicon retina to mimic the structure and mechanism of the biological visual sensing system and aims to address the shortages of traditional frame-based cameras, and it is also a research hotspot in the field of neuroscience and computer vision. Indeed, neuromorphic vision sensors work in a completely different way and use what it called “spikes” to compute instead of frame-by-frame basis, in which asynchronous spatial-temporal spikes are continuous-time and sparse point-sets in three-dimensional space. This novel technology fundamentally changes the sensing and computing ways in vision information, so that existing computer vision techniques cannot be directly applied to asynchronous spikes from neuromorphic cameras. Nevertheless, neuromorphic vision remains an active area of research in academia and efforts are ongoing to overcome some significant challenges. In this paper, the first part presents a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of neuromorphic vision consisting of the millstones, two bio-inspired vision sampling models (i.e., dynamic vision sampling model and integrating vision sampling model), the types of representative neuromorphic sensors (e.g., DVS, ATIS, DAVIS, CeleX, and Vidar), asynchronous event-based signal processing, event-based feature representation and the typical vision applications. Specially, we introduce the fundamentals of neuromorphic signal processing methods, such as asynchronous spatial-temporal filtering, spike metric, and spike coding. According to the literature, we summarize and report experimental results on the key issue, namely event-based feature representation, from four perspectives consisting of rate-based images, hand-crafted features, spiking neural networks (SNNs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). The second part next highlights the following challenges: (i) Building some large-scale neuromorphic vision datasets for supervised learning approaches; (ii) Defining an effective spike metric for neuromorphic signal processing; (iii) Learning a better spatial-temporal representation from asynchronous spikes; (iv) Exploring high-speed computing paradigm via neuromorphic chips (e.g., TrueNorth, Loihi, and SpiNNaker); (v) Developing the open-source framework applied to asynchronous spatial-temporal spikes. The last part further discusses the meaningful future research directions on neuromorphic vision sensors. More precisely, we look forward to new materials to enhance the sensing abilities in computational speed, memory, communication overhead, and power consumption. Then, we analyze the potential profound influence that can be extended to multi-band sampling rather than only visible spectrum, multi-task learning just like human vision systems and multi-sensor fusion. Finally, we anticipate a neuromorphic community combing neuroscience and computer vision, which benefits from each other. We believe that the most alluring characteristic of the comprehensive survey paper is that it acts as a bridge between neuromorphic cameras and many computer vision tasks, thus brining the mainstream of computer vision research to leverage the benefits of these novel sensors and enlarging the footprint of neuromorphic vision towards a broader array of applications.
